### This is for comments, shown by starting with ###.
### Data must be cleaned beforehand!
### Every line is a key-value pair, which is separated by one comma.
### Commas should only be used as separators!
### There should never be whitespaces that do not have meaning.
###
### Every data entry must start with its ID, which has 10 digits.
### Every data entry has the same format.
### There should not be any missing values in a strongest sense (e.g., every location must have its carbon intensity). Use 0s if needed.
###
### The time must continue, and in increasing order.
### The time interval is 0.5 h.
### Every day starts at 00-00.
### The time format: yyyy-mm-dd::HH-MM
###
### Right after carbon_intensity, carbon_intensity_location is its location.
### n pairs of them are expected for n unique locations.
###
### Right after carbon_intensity, carbon_intensity_location is its location.
### n pairs of them are expected for n unique locations.
###
### Right after device_usage, device_id is its corresponding device.
### m pairs of them are expected for m unique devices. Again, use zero if needed to avoid any missing values!
