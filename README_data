# Time data
# --------------------------------------------------
# location: ai-sci-log/Viz/codeJS/src/data/timedata.json

# Caution: so far, the time intervals we can measure is 30min,
# because the cabon intensity real time data we use are updated every 30min
# future: diverging time intervals may be used

# functional units:
# this is a quantitative data property in the broadest sense.
# think about an AI, then in the training phase functional unit will be 1, since you have 1 training phase. For deployment, it could be N with N being the number of requests or prompts the server receives.
# in big data analysis this could refer to number of data points analyzed.
# For Genomics/RNomics, we normalize resulsts to per mio reads. Thus, if you hae a data set of 10 mio reads, function_units is 10

# units of measurement
"carbon_intensities" CO2e kg/kWh
"hardware_usages" fraction (0-1)
"pue": vale >1

# one data set looks like this

			   # setting for running a pice of sortware, etc.

    			      # device_id referes to device.jason

# Hardware devices
# --------------------------------------------------

# For now we collect a limited set of parameters that are hardware specific

# units:
# lifetime: hours [h]  total life time of device estimated

# power_idle: [W] power used when nothing is running on the device
power_variable: [W] power_max of device - power_idle. the power_max you find in the tec specs of the device provided by the manufacturer.
This power variable is used to calculate the actual power used during the software run: power_variable P(s) * CPU_usage(s,dt)

# embodied_carbon: [gCO2e]

# example
