# Caution: so far, the time intervals we can measure is 30min,
# because the cabon intensity real time data we use are updated every 30min
# future: diverging time intervals may be used

# functional units:
# this is a quantitative data property in the broadest sense.
# think about an AI, then in the training phase functional unit will be 1, since you have 1 training phase. For deployment, it could be N with N being the number of requests or prompts the server receives.
# in big data analysis this could refer to number of data points analyzed.
# For Genomics/RNomics, we normalize resulsts to per mio reads. Thus, if you hae a data set of 10 mio reads, function_units is 10

# units of measurement
"carbon_intensities" CO2e kg/kWh
"hardware_usages" fraction (0-1)
